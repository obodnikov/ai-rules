# Amazon Q – Project Rules (ENTRY POINT)

You MUST follow these rules for all answers in this chat.

1. Governing rules are defined in `CLAUDE.md`.
2. Stack-specific rules are in `AI*.md`.
3. Architecture is defined in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `/docs`.
4. DO NOT change architecture or logic unless explicitly asked.
5. Prefer minimal, localized changes.
6. If context is missing, ask for the exact file/path before guessing.
7. Do not invent APIs, configs, or behavior.
8. If instructions conflict, `CLAUDE.md` wins.
